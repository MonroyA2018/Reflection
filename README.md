# Final Reflection!!
## 5/15/2018
Along the year in computing fundamentals two I have been working in a lot of things, like codes, HTML, Java Script, Creating Web pages, etc.
At yhe beggining of the year I didn't think that I was able to handle the work that I was given, I even talked to Mr. Gold about switching classes.
I worked for a lot of time, I practice on my own and I even came to tutorial to ask for help because I didn't understand any of the work that I was given.
Right now I really think I'm capable of doing the tasks that Mr. Gold give me in class, I'm well prepared and I know I can do it now that I know what I am capable of doing.
Thank you Mr. Gold!!

This week in computing fundamentals class I worked a lot on my google fiday project.
I also worked a lot on my coding skills in codeacademy for me to improve on coding.
I finished the course and I improved, I also worked on my Profile project
I create a bootsrap template in which you can see all of my academy facts and my awards.

This week in computing fundamentals class we worked and went more into coding, we learned how to use the "XML" code and we also worked on our reflections assignment in "Ubuntu".
At first I was a little bit confused but after a while practicing and memorizing the codes I learned how to do it properly.
I've been working a lot on doing the coding properly and know I think that I can finally do it correctly

This week at computing fundamentals class we went more into coding and new things.
We learned more about coding. Mr Gold taught us how to put folders into folders by using coding in "Ubuntu".
He also taught us how to clone codes to send one message or file from Ubuntu, to a website called Github.
So our files and messages, go from coding, to an actual website.

This week in computing fundamentals class we review more about decrypting and encrypting secret codes.
But we learned something new this week. We studied a program that teach us how to "code". Coding is something that every computer does, everytime we send a message or write something in our computers, that function is done by a big amount of codes that makes the computer work. 
We are now studing the beginning of coding and doing coding by ourselves.

This week in computing fundamentals 2, we learned how to encrypt and decrypt codes, so if there is a secret
code that you want to know, you decrypt it with kind of like certain clues. 
another thing we learned was to to encrypt sentences into secret codes, so if you only want certain people to know your message, you can tell them how to decrypt it. So that way other people doesn't know your secret message.
I think it is very interesting to encrypt and decrypt secret messages, it's kind of fun.

This week we. This second week of class in computer fundamentals 2 we review the binary system a little bit more, but more than that we learned about algorithms, and learned that polynomial time is slower than log rythmic.
Mr. Gold also taught us how our messages, e-mails, codes, etc. are sent, what the process of sending an e-mail is, that it hs tu go from your computer to a public server somewhere else so that it's sent. 
What I liked the most from these week was about he process of our e-mails, I think is very interesting how that process and how fast it goes.
